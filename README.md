## Abstract (tl;dr)

## Introduction
Universal government-funded health systems are such a complex beast that only 31 of the world's 32 developed nations have been able to make them work. In countries with non-universal healthcare, up to 90% of the population may be uninsured. There is data that exists already linking broader health coverage to better access to necessary care and improved overall health. I expect that, as a result, healthcare type is also indicative of how well-equiped a country is to handle a global pandemic. 

Healthcare type is expected to impact how likely citizens are to seek treatment once they develop COVID symptoms, the prevelance of untreated underlying health conditions, and how healthy the general population is. All of these items will directly impact death numbers. This report examines the COVID-related deaths in countries with universal healthcare, and compares them to the COVID-related deaths in countries with non-universal healthcare.

## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that countries with non-universal health insurance systems experience greater COVID-19 mortality rates than countries with universal government-funded health systems.

In countries that have non-universal health insurance systems, some citizens may have private insurance, some may be eligible for subsidized public healthcare, and some may be completely without insurance. Countries that fall under this category are Bangladesh, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Nigeria, Paraguay, Tanzania, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates, and of course, the United States. Egypt, India, and Indonesia also fall into this category but will be left out of this report, as their healthcare systems are in transition.

In countries with universal government-funded health systems, healthcare is available to all citizens, no matter what. Countries that fall under this category are Australia, Bahrain, Bhutan, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Cuba, Denmark, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Portugal, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom. Taiwan and North Korea also fall into this category but will be left out of this report, as they have not released their coronavirus data.

Other types of healthcare do exist. Some governments provide universal public insurance, universal public-private insurance, or universal private insurance. Those healthcare systems, however, are not examined in this report.

## Datasets used
My main dataset is the World Health Organization's international dataset, which includes number of cases and deaths reported both daily and cumulatively, by country. This dataset is updated daily and can be found at https://covid19.who.int/. Data collection began in mid-January and this report includes data through August 2nd, 2020.

The population dataset I used is from worldbank.org. Key sorces for this dataset are listed as the United Nations, various census reports, and Eurostat, among other reputable sources. It can be found at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL. It is updated yearly, with the most recent data being from 2019.

## Description of analyses

## Conclusions
The data does not support the hypothesis. While countries with non-universal healthcare average more deaths overall than countries with non-universal healthcare, that is due almost entirely to the data from one country - the United States. Countries with universal healthcare saw more deaths, both in total and per capita.
